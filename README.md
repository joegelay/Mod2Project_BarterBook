Barterbook is our Flatiron School's Mod 2 Project. We came up with the idea to create a website that gives people the ability to connect and barter their services for other's services.
This website is built with JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a tiny amount of JQuery. 

### Required Versions

Navigate to the Backend folder and run the following commands in order:<br />
- `bundle-install`
- `rails db:create`

### Starting the Frontend and Backend

To start the servers you will need to:<br />
- Backend:
    - Go into the backend folder and run the following command: `rails s -p 4000`<br />

### Navigating to the Website

After you have started running the Frontend and the Backend, then you will navigate to `http://localhost:3000/landingPage.html`.

### Website Pages
